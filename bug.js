In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using AsyncStorage within a functional component that utilizes `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (`[]`). This setup intends to perform the action only once upon component mount. However, if the action involves a promise (e.g., AsyncStorage's getItem, setItem), and if that promise is rejected, it might lead to silent failures without explicit error handling within the `useEffect` hook.  The component will continue rendering without any visible indication that the AsyncStorage operation failed. This is because the `useEffect` hook doesn't inherently catch or propagate promise rejections unless explicitly handled.
