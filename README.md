This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Native applications related to AsyncStorage operations within useEffect hooks.  The bug showcases how promise rejections from AsyncStorage can go unhandled when using an empty dependency array in useEffect, leading to silent failures in data fetching or storage. The solution highlights the importance of explicit error handling within the async function to prevent these issues.  This is crucial for building robust and reliable React Native applications.
